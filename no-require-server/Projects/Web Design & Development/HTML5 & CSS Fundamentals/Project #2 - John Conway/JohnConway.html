                    One Cambridge tale that Conway loves to tell features his then landlord and colleague Stephen Hawking: The Hawkings came to tea, and Conway was keen to
                    showoff what he considers his most brilliant invention: a matchbox rigged up to turn on a light switch inconveniently hidden behind a door. Hawking,
                    himself having suffered for that light switch, now ingeniously conquered, began laughing and laughing, then laughing and coughing, and he couldn’t stop.
                    Conway started to worry. Thankfully, the fit passed. “I hadn’t killed the great cosmologist after all,” he said. “And that was a great relief.”

                <h3 class="title" id="GameOLife">Conway's Game Of Life</h3>
                    <p id="SideContent" class="Paragraphs">
                        Conway is especially known for the invention of the Game of Life, one of the early examples of a cellular automaton. His initial experiments in that field were
                        done with pen and paper, long before personal computers existed.<br /><br />

                        Since the game was introduced by Martin Gardner in Scientific American in 1970, it has spawned hundreds of computer programs, web sites, and articles.
                        It is a staple of recreational mathematics. There is an extensive wiki devoted to curating and cataloging the various aspects of the game. From the earliest
                        days it has been a favorite in computer labs, both for its theoretical interest and as a practical exercise in programming and data display. At times Conway has
                        said he hates the Game of Life–largely because it has come to overshadow some of the other deeper and more important things he had done.
                        Nevertheless, the game did help launch a new branch of mathematics, the field of cellular automata. <br /><br />

                        The Game of Life is now known to be Turing complete.

            <p class="content">
                <b>Conway</b> was born in <em>Liverpool</em>, the son of <b>Cyril Horton Conway</b> and <b>Agnes Boyce</b>. He became interested in mathematics at a very early
                age; his mother has recalled that he could recite the <em>powers of two</em> when he was <em>four years old</em>. By the age of eleven his ambition was to become
                a mathematician.<br /><br />

                After leaving sixth form, Conway entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge to study mathematics. Conway, who was a "terribly
                introverted adolescent" in school, interpreted his admission to Cambridge as an opportunity to transform himself into a new person: an "extrovert".<br /><br />

                He was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1959 and began to undertake research in number theory supervised by Harold Davenport.
                Having solved the open problem posed by Davenport on writing numbers as the sums of fifth powers, Conway began to become
                interested in infinite ordinals. It appears that his interest in games began during his years studying the Cambridge Mathematical
                Tripos, where he became an avid backgammon player, spending hours playing the game in the common room. He was awarded his doctorate
                in 1964 and was appointed as College Fellow and Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.<br /><br />

                After leaving Cambridge in 1986, he took up the appointment to the John von Neumann Chair of Mathematics at Princeton University.
