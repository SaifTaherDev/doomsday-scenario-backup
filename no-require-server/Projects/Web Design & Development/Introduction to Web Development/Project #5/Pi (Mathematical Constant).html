<p id="para1">The number π (/paɪ/) is a mathematical constant. Originally defined as the ratio of a
 circle's circumference to its diameter, it now has various equivalent definitions and appears in many
 formulas in all areas of mathematics and physics. It is approximately equal to 3.14159. It has been
 represented by the Greek letter "π" since the mid-18th century, though it is also sometimes spelled
 out as "pi". It is also called Archimedes’ constant.[1]</p>
