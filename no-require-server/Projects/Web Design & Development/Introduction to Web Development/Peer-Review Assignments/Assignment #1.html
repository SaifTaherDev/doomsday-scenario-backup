<p style="float:center;font-family:Berlin Sans FB;font-size:150%;"><strong>Pi Day</strong> is celebrated on 
<i>March 14th (3/14)</i> around the world. <strong>Pi (Greek letter “π”)</strong> is the
 symbol used in mathematics to represent a <i>constant</i> — the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
 diameter — which is approximately <i>3.14159</i>. <strong>Pi Day</strong> is an annual opportunity for math enthusiasts to recite the infinite
 digits of Pi, talk to their friends about math, and to eat Pie. Their also happnes to be a very fortuante coincidence, which is that Enistien was born on Pi day, and Steven Hawking died on Pi day.

<strong>Pi</strong> has been calculated to over <i>one trillion</i> digits beyond its decimal point.
 As an <i>irrational and transcendental</i> number, it will continue <u>infinitely</u> without
 repetition or pattern. While only a handful of digits are needed for typical calculations,
 Pi’s infinite nature makes it a fun challenge to memorize, and to computationally calculate
 more and more digits...</P>
