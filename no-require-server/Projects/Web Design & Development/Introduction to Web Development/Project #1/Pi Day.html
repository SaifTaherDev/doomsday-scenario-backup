<p><strong><em> Pi day</strong></em>  is a special day for Math Nerds in general. Its title comes from the fact that <strong>Pi</strong>,
 the matematical constant which is used to compute the <em>circumfrunce</em> and <em>area</em> of circles,
 starts with the digits <strong>3,1, and 4</strong> (3.14). This day has arosen many controversies over the past months, mainly because of a very fortuante coinidence, so to say.
 <strong>Enistien</strong> was born on <em>14th of March</em>, And <strong>Steven Hawking </strong> has died on the <em>14th of march</em>, 2018... Yes, I know. Frightning, but it's God's willings.
